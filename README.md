# Fraktur Construction Kit

[Based on the Historic Tale Construction Kit](http://htck.github.io/bayeux)

## Features
This brand new Historic Tale Construction Kit allows you to
* Drag, drop, scale, rotate any item from the fraktur image bank
* Do the same with text with different fonts and colors
* Bring elements to the front/back of the scene (this **is** life changing)
* Work on several images (pages) at once
* Export those pages as PNG or as GIF
* Save a working copy of your tapestry to your disk, to finish it later
* Use brushes to quickly add elements
* Use keyboard shortcuts for almost all of the above
* Download a standalone version to use it anywhere without any server
